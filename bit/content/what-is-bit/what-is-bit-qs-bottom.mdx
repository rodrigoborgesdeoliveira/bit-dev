Bit does not prescribe how to build your entire application. It helps you define and compose components and allows for every component to adopt the dev tools that best fit its nature.
A React component is likely to be compiled, tested and perhaps even deployed using a composition of tools different than the one a backend-service component, or a generic function, may use.
Bit comes with native support in various dev tools like TypeScript, Babel, Jest, Webpack, ESLint, and ready made development environments for React, NodeJS, Angular and more. New tools can be easily integrated by adding one more component into Bit!
