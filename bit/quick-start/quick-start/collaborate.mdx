## Collaborate

Now that we have done our work and all seems to be working locally, its time to share our changes and collaborate with others.  
Bit tells you which components changed and their current [status](/workspace/workspace-status).

<BitStatus />

### Create a remote scope

A [Scope](/scope/scope-overview) is a collaboration server for components. It enables you to export components created in your workspace, to have them stored remotely, and to collaborate on them with others. Other developers, with access to your scope, can use your components or propose changes to them.

Scopes help organize components in a shared domain of responsibility. For example, the `analytics` scope will include all components that provide Analytics services, and the `design` scope will include the services for our design language.

<!--
Scopes can be created for every responsibility, for example: `wiki` or `design`

On a deeper level, scopes are used to define responsibility over components in the same sense microservices are used to define ownership and boundaries over software services.
On a deeper level, scopes are used to define responsibility since all  -->

<!-- Scopes define ownership on components, as a single team owns the components exported to a scope.
You can host multiple types of components in a scope, from "small" components all the way to frontend apps or microservices.
Earlier we have chosen a default Scope for our workspace. We need to either host our own scope, or use [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud).  -->

<!-- TODO: @ella Add relavent scope cards here -->

If you don't have a remote scope yet, it is a good time to create one! You can create and host scopes on [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud) for free
or [self-host your scope](/scope/running-a-scope-server).

<CreateAccount className={centerColumn} />

Once you've created a new remote scope, update the `defaultScope` property of your workspace to the new scope name:

<ScopeRename />

### Snap your changes

Run the following to record your component changes:

<SnapAllExample />

Run the following to record your component changes and tag them with a semantic release version:

<TagAllExample />

### Create a Lane (alpha)

By default, component changes are recorded on the main lane. You can create a new lane and use it to propose changes to multiple-components (in the main lane):

<CreateLaneExample />

Once a new lane has been created (and automatically, switched to), you can run the following to record component changes in that lane:

<SnapAllInLaneExample />

### Export changes to remote scopes

After recoding component changes with snaps or tags, you can sync the staging changes with the defined remote scopes.

<ExportExample />

### Be aware to how changes affect others

Bit automatically detects affected dependents in your Workspace. It is a best practice to import few or more dependents and test
your changes against them prior to releasing.

<ImportWithDependentsExample />

Running `test` and `build` can test your modified components vs affected dependencies.

## Have an idea for your own Quick Start?

If you think you can build a better quick start, or just show anything else. Head over to the
[Quick start for creating Quick Starts](https://bit.cloud/teambit/bit/quick-start), share your own and let us know about it!
