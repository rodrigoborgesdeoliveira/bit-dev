# External Dependencies

External dependencies are components or packages that are installed and resolved from the [node_modules](/dependencies/node-modules) directory.
These dependencies are listed in the components' dependency config and the workspace dependency policy.
In contrary to ['Workspace component links'](/workspace/structure/component-links), these dependencies are not linked to any component maintained in that workspace.

Use the `bit install` command to install all external dependencies.

```bash
// Read the dependency policies and install any missing package, accordingly
bit install
```

```bash
// Install @teambit/base-ui.button and add it to the workspaces dependency policy
bit install @teambit/base-ui.button
```

The installation process is done by the package manager configured in the Dependency Resolver. Transitive dependencies (the dependencies of dependencies, and so on) are installed as well.

## Package dependencies

Packages dependencies can be installed from the NPM registry or from any other custom registry configured to your `.npmrc` file.

## Component dependencies

Components are installed as standard packages. Bit identifies them by using the `componentId` property on the component's `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "name": "@teambit/base-ui.button",
  "componentId": "teambit.base-ui/button"
}
```
