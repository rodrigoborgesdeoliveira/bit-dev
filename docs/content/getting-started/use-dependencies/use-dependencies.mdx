# Use Dependencies

For a component to be composable and independent, it must maintain its own dependency graph. This graph can include packages, as well as other components.

To add a dependency to a component, include a standard `import`/`require` statement in any of its files. Bit will automatically detect these statements and include them in the component's dependency graph.

For example, the following adds the [`teambit.design/inputs/input-text`](https://bit.cloud/teambit/design/inputs/input-text) component as a dependency of (the previously-created) [`my-org.tasks-scope/apps/to-do`](https://bit.cloud/my-org/tasks-scope/apps/to-do?version=0.0.2) component:

```ts
import { InputText } from '@teambit/design.inputs.input-text';
```

<ExpandedCode />

Notice how this dependency is consumed as a standard package, even though it is a component.
_This would be true even if that dependency was maintained in the same workspace._ Bit makes this possible by generating a package for each component, during its development and during its build.

Consuming components via their (absolute) package name, makes them usable in any context, whether is is a different workspace or even a non-Bit project.

Run following to [install](/dependencies/dependency-installation) the the above dependency:

<InstallExample />

<ExpandedCommand />

:::info Installing components in non-Bit projects
You can install components using standard package managers like npm and Yarn, in Bit and non-Bit projects. To learn more, see [Installing components](/components/installing-components).
:::

Run the following to review the component's data:

<ShowTodo />

The output lists the above dependency as a direct dependency of [`my-org.tasks-scope/apps/to-do`](https://bit.cloud/my-org/tasks-scope/apps/to-do?version=0.0.2):

<BitShowTodo />

Bit maintains a dependency graph of all components in the workspace. This graph is used, among other things, to propagate changes from components to their dependents.

To review the full dependency graph of a component, including its indirect dependencies, head over to the component's
'Dependencies' tab in the UI. Notice how this component has 2 additional indirect dependencies.

## Dependency policy and dependency resolution

The previously installed dependency is now registered in the workspace [dependency policy](/dependencies/dependency-policies) (see it in the `workspace.jsonc` file below).

The dependency policy defines the [external dependencies](/dependencies/external-dependencies) that are to be installed in that workspace. Note that a workspace policy does not automatically add a dependency to a component.
If a dependency is not used by a component, it is not included in its dependency graph.

The version and type of a dependency are determined by Bit after considering multiple sources (listed here by order of importance):
[component dependency config](/dependencies/configuring-dependencies) (defined manually), [dependencies defined via aspects](/dependencies/configuring-dependencies#configuring-from-aspects) (programmatically), [dependencies defined via envs](/dependencies/configuring-dependencies#configuring-dependencies-from-an-env) (programmatically), and lastly, the [workspace dependency policy](/dependencies/dependency-policies) and Bit's automatic dependency detection.

### Dependency types

The previously installed dependency was resolved by Bit as a standard dependency since there are no configurations or policies that define it differently.
In addition to standard dependencies, Bit supports dev dependencies and peer dependencies.

#### Dev dependencies

Dev dependencies can be packages or other components. A dependency is defined as a 'dev dependency' if it's configured as such (manually or programmatically), or if the dependency is only used by the component's [dev files](/components/structure/dev-files) (e.g, test files, documentation files, etc.).

#### Peer dependencies

Peer dependencies can be packages or other components. These are dependencies that are expected to be included in a component's host application.
Since peer dependencies play a special "public role" in an app, such as the medium of communication between modules or the app's global state, they are required to exist in just a single instance, a single version.

The peer dependencies of a component are usually configured by its env or by the workspace dependency policy. Note that while components are configured with lenient peer dependency versions (to make them compatible with a wide range of hosts), the host itself (an env or an app) use a concrete version.
