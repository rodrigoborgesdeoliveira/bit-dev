#### Peer dependencies

The 'peer dependencies' property lists the component peer dependencies.

Peer dependencies are dependencies that are expected to be included in a component's host application.
Since peer dependencies play a special "public role" in an app, such as the medium of communication between modules or the app's global state, they are required to exist in just a single instance, a single version.

See the [Dependency policy and dependency resolution](#dependency-policy-and-dependency-resolution) section to learn how Bit resolves the dependency type and version.
