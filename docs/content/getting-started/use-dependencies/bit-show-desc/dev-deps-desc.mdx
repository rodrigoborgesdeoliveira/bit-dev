#### Dev dependencies

The 'dev dependencies' property lists the component dev dependencies (dependencies that are used for its development and are not used in runtime).

See the [Dependency policy and dependency resolution](#dependency-policy-and-dependency-resolution) section to learn how Bit resolves the dependency type and version.
