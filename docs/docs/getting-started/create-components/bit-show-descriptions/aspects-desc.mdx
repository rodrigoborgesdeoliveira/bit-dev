#### Aspects

The 'aspects' property lists the Bit aspects configured on a component.

Bit aspects are a type of full-stack components that compose Bit. Aspects shape how components are developed and what data they store.
A component is configured, by default, with Bit's core aspects. These aspects persist data in the component version to enable consistency in how it is developed and maintained across workspaces.

To learn more about aspects and how to extend Bit with your own custom aspects, see [Aspects overview](https://bit.dev/docs/extending-bit/aspect-overview).
