#### Dev files

The 'dev files' property lists the component files used only for developed. Files are registered as 'dev files' by the Bit aspects that handle them.
For example, the tester aspect lists `.spec.ts` files as dev files, and the docs aspect lists `.docs.mdx` files as dev files (both are shown to the right of each listed file).

Knowing which file is a dev file can be useful in various cases. For example, if a component consumes another component only via its dev files, then this dependency is a dev dependency.
