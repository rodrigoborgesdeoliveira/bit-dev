#### Files

The 'files' property lists the files that are tracked as files of this component.
Files are tracked only if they are included inside the [component directory](https://bit.dev/docs/workspace/structure/component-directory), or sub-directories of it.

Files are not tracked if they are part of Bit's default 'ignore list' (for example, `node_modules`) or if they are listed in the workspace `.gitignore` files.
