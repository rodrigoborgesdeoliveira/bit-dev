#### Scope name

A scope name defines the owner of a component. That can be a single user, a team or an organization.

A scope name also references a specific 'remote scope' where a component is to be exported to. In this case, the remote scope is hosted by [bit.cloud](https://bit.cloud).
Scopes on bit.cloud use the `<account>.<scope-name>` pattern.

A Remote Scope is configured with its own read/write permission levels. When you define a scope for a component, you also define who can collaborate on that component.

To learn more about scope names, see [Component ID](https://bit.dev/docs/components/structure/component-id).

To learn more about remote scopes, see [Scope Overview](https://bit.dev/docs/scope/scope-overview).
