#### Dev dependencies

The 'dev dependencies' property lists the component dev dependencies (dependencies that are used for its development and are not used in runtime).
These dependencies can be packages or other components.

The dependencies for this component were configured by the component's env and workspace.

New dev dependencies are detected and added automatically when a component consumes a new package or component.
A dependency is defined as a 'dev dependency' if it's configured as such (manually or programmatically), or if the dependency is only used by the component's [dev files](https://bit.dev/docs/components/structure/dev-files).

To learn more about dependencies, see [Dependencies overview](https://bit.dev/docs/dependencies/dependencies-overview)
