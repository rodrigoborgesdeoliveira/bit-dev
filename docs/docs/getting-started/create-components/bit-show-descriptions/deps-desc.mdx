#### Dependencies

The 'dependencies' property lists the component regular dependencies. These dependencies can be packages or other components.

The dependencies for this component were configured by the component's env and workspace.

New dependencies are detected and added automatically when a component consumes a new package or component.
The type and version of a component is resolved by Bit after taking into consideration multiple factors such as the component's env, the workspace.jsonc, and more.
