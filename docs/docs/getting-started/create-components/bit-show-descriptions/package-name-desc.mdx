#### Package name

Bit generates a standard NodeJS package for each component in the workspace.
It creates a temporary package for components that are still in development, and generates the release package when a component is versioned.

Components are always consumed using their (absolute) package name, and never using relative paths to their source files.

A component's package name correlates to its component ID:

<Image
  maxWidth={300}
  src={packageName}
  alt="a package name correlates to its component id"
/>

To learn more about packages for components maintained in the workspace, see [Workspace component links](https://bit.dev/docs/workspace/structure/component-links).
