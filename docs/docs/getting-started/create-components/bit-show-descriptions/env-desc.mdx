#### Development environments (Env)

A [development environment (Env)](https://bit.dev/docs/getting-started/composing/dev-environments) is a type of component that provides other components with pre-defined component config, and a collection of dev tools and procedures.
These include component documentation, compilation, testing, building and more.

Envs are configured directly on components, not on workspaces. They enable you to standardize the way different components are developed.

This component was set by the 'react' template to use the [React env](https://bit.dev/docs/frameworks/react/react-overview).
