Run the following to generate a new workspace using one of the [available workspace templates](https://bit.dev/docs/dev-services/generator/generator-overview):

<BitNew />

For example, the following creates a workspace using the 'react' template. It sets `my-org.tasks-workspace` as the default scope for components in that workspace
(remote scopes hosted on bit.cloud are prefixed with the scope owner: `<owner>.<scope-name>`):

<BitNewWithValues />

The output is similar to the following:

<NewWorkspaceOutput />

To preview your workspace components and inspect your workspace status using the UI, run the following:

<CdMyWorkspace />

<BitStartWithValues />

The output displays the port for the UI server:

<BitStartOutput />

Head to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. Right now your workspace is empty as no component is being tracked.

At any point during your component development, run the following to get a detailed status of your workspace:

<BitStatus />

To learn more about the different possible workspace statuses see [Workspace status](https://bit.dev/docs/workspace/workspace-status).
