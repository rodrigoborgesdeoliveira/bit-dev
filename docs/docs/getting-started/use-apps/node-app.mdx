:::info Deploying an app
Node apps do not provide their own default deployer. To learn how to set a deployer see [App deployment](https://bit.dev/docs/apps/app-deployment).
To explore a demo Node app with a deployer, see this [Cloudflare worker](https://bit.cloud/teambit/cloud-providers/aspects/cloudflare-worker) or this [AWS Lambda](https://bit.cloud/learnbit/apps/aws/lambda/hello-world-lambda).
