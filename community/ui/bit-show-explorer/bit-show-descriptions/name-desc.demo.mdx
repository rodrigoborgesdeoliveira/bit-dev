#### Component name

This is the component's name. A component's name is defined when creating a new component (`bit create COMPONENT_NAME`).

Use the component name to perform actions on components in your workspace (not in remote scopes as they require the full id).

To learn more, see [Component ID](https://bit.dev/docs/components/structure/component-id).
