# Forking Components

When you fork a component from a remote scope, you create a copy of it in your workspace. This copy is [defined as 'new'](https://bit.dev/docs/workspace/workspace-status#new-components), and has no previous versions.
The scope of that copied component is set, by default, to your workspace default scope (defined in the `defaultScope` property).

Run the following to fork a component:

<ForkCommand />

For example, the following command forks `teambit.design/basic/button` to your workspace:

<ForkCommandBasicExample />

Run the following to fork a component and change its scope to a scope different than your workspace default scope:

<ForkCommandSetScopeExample />

## Refactoring

Use the `--refactor` option to update the import statements in all dependent components (in the same workspace). For example:

<ForkRefactorExample />

All occurrences of `import { Button } from '@teambit/design.basic.button'` are now replaced by `import { Button } from '@my-org/my-scope.basic.button'`.
